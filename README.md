# horiseon-refactor

## Description

As part of our first weekly challenge, we were asked to refactor the index.html and style.css files for a webpage to render them more accessible and compliant
with semantic html format. The project was built to apply the concepts covered in week 1 of the software development bootcamp. The problems solved include but are not limited
to:

- Code was not written in semantic html format
- Links in navigation bar were not directing end-user to correct section on web page
- style.css was redundant and not reflective of changes made to comply with semantic html standards

As part of this assignment, I learned what semantic html format is as well as how to apply said format. I also took an in-depth look at the rules of CSS inheritance
and specificity and how they influence styling in an index.html file.

## Usage

See the assets/images folder for a mock-up screenshot of the refactored Horiseon webpage (entitled horiseon-webpage.png). ![Mock-up] (assets/images/horiseon-webpage.png). You will notice that refactoring of the index.html file resulted in minimal visual
changes to the webpage

## Credits

The index.html refactor was completed in conjunction with the software development boot camp provided by the Georgia Tech professional development program.
